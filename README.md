# V. LeVan Smith
Hellooo! 안녕! Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile and checking out my website repository. I thought I'd keep this repository public so you can see a little bit into how I code.

You can see this in action at [http://levansmith.me](http://levansmith.me)

It's built using React and I shamelessly used `create-react-app` to get it all started. In the words of our beloved Kimberly "Sweet Brown" Wilkins, "Ain't nobody got time for that!"

Some cool frameworks I'm using for this are: React (obviously) and Bulma (for CSS).

## Development preferences
- vim
- VSCode
- tmux
- Chrome, although I've been seduced by Firefox at times...
- Lots of others, but these are the big ones I use to make sure I'm productive
